## Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive overview of my HTML/CSS project, which focuses on creating an interactive NFT preview card component. The component is designed to showcase the essential features of digital artworks in the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, providing users with a visually appealing and informative stub for potential buyers.

### The Challenge
The primary challenge was to create a visually engaging component that adheres to modern web design principles while effectively conveying crucial information about each NFT item, including the image, title, creator, price, and additional details.
